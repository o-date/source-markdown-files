# Getting Started {-}

We wrote this text with a particular kind of student in mind. We imagined this student as having already taken a first year introductory course to archaeology, of the kind that surveys the field, its history, and its principle methods and theoretical positions. Very few courses of that kind include any depth in digital methods and theory, which is understandable when we look at the incredible variety of archaeological work, skills, and interests! Digital work is every bit as diverse as other kinds of archaeology, but it also presents its own particular challenges. One of these is the anxiety that comes when one first approaches the computer for anything more complex than word processing or a bit of social media. 'What happens if I break it?'; 'I'm not techy!'; 'If I wanted to do computers, I wouldn't have gone into this!' are all actual student concerns that we have heard in our various classrooms.

It'll be ok.

We take a pedagogical perspective that focuses on the learning that happens when we make things, when we experiment or otherwise play around with materials and computing, and especially, when/if things break. It's a perspective that finds value in 'failing gloriously', in trying to push ourselves beyond our comfort level. The only thing that you will need therefore to be successful in learning some of the basic issues around digital archaeology is a willingness to consider why things didn't work the way they ought to have, and a web browser. We built this textbook with its very own digital archaeology computer built right in! There's nothing you can break on your own machine, nor does your machine have to be very powerful.

Our hope for this volume is that it will provide you with the ability to work out what you need to know, what you don't know, and how to creatively use the computational power of the devices available to you, to do better archaeology. Once you've outgrown this text, we strongly recommend that you visit the peer-reviewed collection of tutorials at [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) (which are available in English and Spanish and soon other languages). If you are more interested in the statistical side of digital archaeology, then you should consult Ben Marwick et al [How to Do Archaeological Science Using R](https://benmarwick.github.io/How-To-Do-Archaeological-Science-Using-R/). 

## Instructors: How to use this text {-}

There is a logic to how this text is organized that means one _could_ use it in its entirety for developing a course around digital archaeology. It does not assume much digital fluency on the part of students, but builds towards progressively more complex topics. Exercises and further readings are suggested in each section. The text can be used in conjunction with the notebooks, or without them. Alternatively, one can pick from the various notebooks (and their integral texts) and build a course around their use. The source text files for this text are available in [this repository](https://github.com/o-date/source-markdown-files) and they may be cut-and-pasted into your own coursepacks as appropriate. 

Because the source text and code are all open, one could assign students the task of improving, adding to, or altering the text to suit local circumstances. Feel free to fork (take a copy) of the entire project for your own pedagogical needs (but note that any resulting work has to be shared under similar terms). Any changes that get folded back into this source material will be reflected with authorship credentials.

## Students: How to use this text {-}

Each section in this book is broken down into an overview or discussion of the main concepts, and then followed up with skill-building exercises. The computational environment - provided via a Jupyter notebook- is running on someone else's servers. When you close the browser, it shuts down. 

**Warning!** The computational notebooks that we provide are running in the [binder](http://mybinder.org) environment and _will time out_ after **ten** minutes' inactivity. 

Your work can be saved to your own machine and reloaded into the environment later, or you can 'push' your changes to your own online repository of work (to learn how to push work to a Github repository, see the sections on [Github & Version Control] and [Open Notebook Research & Scholarly Communication] so you'll be able to get your work and data out of the Jupyter Notebooks and onto space that you control). The best way to use this book is to make sure you have at least one hour blocked out to read through a section, and then two hours to go through the section again if you're working on the exercises. We find that the work goes better if those blocks are interspersed with breaks every twenty minutes or so.

Do you notice that stripe down the side of the screen at the right? That's a tool-bar for annotating the text, using a tool called `Hypothes.is`. If you highlight any text (go ahead, highlight that phrase right now by right-clicking and dragging your mouse!) a little pop-up will ask you if you want to annotate or highlight the text. If you choose annotate, a writing pane will open on the right. Using the Hypothesis tool requires a reader to create a login and account with Hypothesis, which is managed by the Hypothesis site, not us.

By default, such annotations are made public. Private annotations can only be viewed by the particular individual who made them. All annotations (both public and private) have their own unique URL and can be collated in various ways using the Hypothesis API (here's an [example](http://jonudell.net/h/facet.html)). Please tag your annotation with `odate` to allow easy curating of the public annotations.

Please note that any public annotations can be read by any other reader. These can also be responded to, as well - which might make a great classroom activity! A class can create group annotations which are only visible to participants in that group ([instructions here](https://hypothes.is/blog/introducing-groups/)). Annotation is a tool for research; personal reaction to anything we've written in ODATE should be done via the reader’s blog while leaving an annotation on ODATE linking to the blog piece. Because the API or 'application programming interface' for Hypothesis allows one to retrieve annotations programmatically, there is a growing world of scripts and plugins for managing or retrieving those annotations. Kris Shaffer has created a Wordpress plugin to pull annotations to a new Wordpress post ([details are linked here](http://pushpullfork.com/2016/08/hypothesis-aggregator/)), which might be another great option for a class blog working through ODATE.

Over time, the parts of the text that are heavily annotated will look as if someone has gone over them with a yellow highlighter. You can use this to help guide your reading - perhaps that's a part where many people had problems, or perhaps it's a part that sparked a really interesting discussion! Group annotation like this promotes 'active reading', which means that you're more likely to retain the discussion.

Finally, if you'd rather not read this as a web page, you can grab a pdf copy by pressing the download button above (the downwards-facing arrow icon) and printing out just the bits you want or need (warning; some of the layout might not translate well as pdf). If you'd rather read this text via an e-reader or iBooks or similar, the download link will also give you an ePub version. Individuals who use a screenreader or other assistive device might prefer to work with the pdf or epub versions. Please do let us know if there is any way we can make this text more accessible for users with particular needs. Since this text is fundamentally a series of plain-text files that we then manipulate to create these different outputs, it should be straightforward for us to adapt accordingly!


## How to contribute changes, or make your own version {-}

Perhaps your professor has assigned a portion of this text to your class, with the instruction to improve it. Do you see the edit button at the top of the screen (it looks like a little square with a pencil)? If you click on that, and you have an account on Github (and you're signed in), you will grab a copy of this entire text that you can then edit. If you want, you can also make a `pull-request` to us, asking us to fold your changes into our textbook. We welcome these suggestions! Since this book has a creative-commons license, you are welcome to expand and build upon this as you wish, but do cite and link back to the original version.

Instructors can take a copy of this repository as well, and re-edit or recombine the text in whatever ways will serve their learning goals best. We knit the markdown together inside [R Studio](https://rstudio.com) with the [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/home/) package. References are kept in the bibtex format in a `.bib` file. (For more information, see the colophon below.)

## How to access and use the computational environment {-}

There are two options. We created a set of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) coupled with the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) service as a way of serving and running the notebooks online in a browser. This relieves both instructors and students of the problems of installing software in different environments and the troubleshooting that this entails. Instead, students and instructors can concentrate on the learning and writing literate code that explores archaeological issues. To launch the ODATE notebooks, please go to the [our list of notebooks](https://o-date.github.io/support/notebooks-toc/) and hit the `launch binder` button (after reading the information there). Students can use the built in file manager to download or upload notebooks into the environment.

Alternatively, instructors might want to use the [DHBox](http://dhbox.org), which is a linux based computer accessible through a browser. The DHBox has a bit more flexibility, and includes Jupyter notebooks and RStudio by default. The DHBox perists for as long as a month, and so students don't have to be as mindful of saving their work to their _own_ machines, as perhaps they do with the Binder service. At the DHBox site, students create a new user account. They should select the maximum amount of time available for the box. Each time a person logins, the box will tell them how much time remains for the account. Students can use the built-in file manager to download their work from the box to their own machine.

It is worth noting that any jupyter notebook can be read within either environment (and of course, students can install Jupyter onto their own machines if they so desire). Jupyter notebooks can be written in both python or R. Jupyter notebooks are quickly becoming a standard for 'literate programming', where the reflective text and the code are interwoven for the purposes of reproducibility and replicability.


## Colophon {-}

This text was created using the [Bookdown](http://bookdown.org) package for R Markdown. [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a variant of the simple [Markdown format](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) created by John Gruber. That is to say, at its core this text is a series of simple text-files marked up with simple markers of syntax like `#` marks to indicate headings and so on. R Markdown allows us to embed code snippets within the text that an interpreter, like [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/), knows how to run, such that the results of the calculations become embedded in the surrounding discussion! This is a key part of making research more open and more reproducible, and which you'll learn more about in chapter one.

The sequence of steps to produce a Bookdown-powered site looks like this:

1. create a new project in RStudio (we typically create a new project in a brand new folder)
2. run the following script to install Bookdown:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

3. create a new textfile with `metadata` that describe how the book will be built. The metadata is in a format called `YAML` ('yet another markup language') that uses keys and values that get passed into other parts of Bookdown:

```bash
title: "The archaeology of spoons"
author: "Graham, Gupta, Carter, & Compton"
date: "July 1 2017"
description: "A book about cocleararchaeology."
github-repo: "my-github-account/my-project"
cover-image: "images/cover.png"
url: 'https\://my-domain-ex/my-project/'
bibliography: myproject.bib
biblio-style: apa-like
link-citations: yes
```

This is the only thing you need to have in this file, which is saved in the project folder as `index.Rmd`.

4. Write! We write the content of this book as text files, saving the parts in order. Each file should be numbered `01-introduction.Rmd`, `02-a-history-of-spoons.Rmd`, `03-the-spoons-of-site-x.Rmd` and so on.

5. Build the book. With Bookdown installed, there will be a 'Build Book' button in the R Studio build pane. This will generate the static html files for the book, the pdf, and the epub. All of these will be found in a new folder in your project, `_book`. There are many more customizations that can be done, but that is sufficient to get one started.
