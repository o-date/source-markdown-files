# On the Horizons: Where Digital Archaeology Might Go Next

As an undergraduate, Graham wrote in an essay at the dawn of the Web (thus, mid 1990s), after being disappointed by the results of a search on [Alta Vista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista) "so-called the world wide web will never be of use for academics".

Given that historical lack of vision, we are hesitant to proclaim where digital archaeology might go next. So why don't you tell us? Annotate this page, these words, with links to your own digital archaeology projects and explorations. Help us improve and expand this text.

Where digital archaeology might go next depends on _you_.
