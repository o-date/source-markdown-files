# On the Horizons: Where Digital Archaeology Might Go Next

As an undergraduate in the mid 1990s, Graham was asked to go on the 'world wide web' to develop an annotated bibliography of websites concerning the Etruscans. After being disappointed by the results of a search on [Alta Vista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista), he wrote: "this so-called the world wide web will never be of use for academics".

Our ability to predict the future is thus suspect.

Given that historical lack of vision, we are hesitant to proclaim where digital archaeology might go next. So why don't you tell us? Annotate this page, these words, with links to your own digital archaeology projects and explorations. Help us improve and expand this text.

Where digital archaeology might go next depends on _you_.
