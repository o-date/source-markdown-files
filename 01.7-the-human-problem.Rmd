## The Human Problem

A key to success in using, remixing, and sharing data openly is communicating effectively with colleagues and other stakeholders. Whether you are utilizing data that already existed or creating a totally new dataset, your work impacts colleagues, and it is important to build not only a technical framework but social supports for your work. A successful digital archaeology project is one which is well-understood and well-regarded by colleagues. In the following section I will describe how to frame digital archaeology work for colleagues and others who may be interested or impacted by it, and share three key tools for establishing boundaries and expectations for your project.

Outline

1. Colleagues
  + Can be difficult to move forward when data sharing is not necessarily the norm, and there are not norms around how to do it
  + Establish boundaries regarding what you are doing
  + Explain why what you are doing is part of, rather than separate from, previous meaningful work in your research realm
  + People are hesitant to let the data they spent so much time and effort and money creating be used in ways they have no control over
  + Key is being clear about your intentions and the roles of each person in the exchange
  + Even if you are creating data "From scratch" there are colleagues whose work will be impacted by your contribution, so thinking about how your work interfaces with theirs will allow you to more carefully plan so that your work is seen as a positive contribution to the literature rather than disruptive in a negative way, or even worse, useless
  + The sheer volume of data produced by archaeologists and the time it takes to code and manage our collections leads us to be slow to adopt new technologies, even if we are on board with them. Consider this and do not write people off for being slow to agree to your innovative technology-based ideas.
  + Address the importance of this planning for early career and contingent researchers and students in particular
2. Stakeholders Beyond Archaeology
  + Example: Cemetery project
  + Sometimes stakeholders are individuals, sometimes they are institutions or vague groups/entities; address who to choose and the stakes of deciding this
  + The power of informal working groups for getting feedback and direction
  + Managing expectations
  + Sharing outputs and picking appropriate formats
3. Build a Plan for Yourself
4. Make Your Case
  + The Group Meeting
  + The Strategy Document
  + The Policy Document
